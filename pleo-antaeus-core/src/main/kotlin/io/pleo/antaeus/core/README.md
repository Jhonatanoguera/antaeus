## Development log

Alright, as requested, this README will work as a sort of log where I'll be noting up the process of
developing the Antaeus challenge.

First, a quick self reminder to fix the UNIX line ends for running the app on Windows

So, I've been using Windows for over a year now as the OS where I generally code, noticed Docker has
some issues and requires a specific version of windows 10 to work locally unless I use the docker
toolbox, sadly, never been able to enable virtualization on this pc despite being suported. Moved to
my Linux partition which hasn't been toucher for over a year now and more errors popped up based on
my Linux partition state. Unluckily, I've dropped the idea on fixing it and requested some help
which is now allowing me to properly run the docker and the application!
